Passport Pals is a **prototype web application** designed to reimagine travel as a form of **cultural exchange**, rather than a commercial transaction. Instead of hotels or generic tourist experiences, Passport Pals connects like-minded travelers who **host and get hosted** in each other’s homes while exploring new countries through real local perspectives.

The concept is inspired by student exchange programs and modern swipe-based apps, combining **interest and personality matching** with a community-driven approach to travel. The focus is on meaningful connections, shared experiences, and discovering a place through the people who live there.

**Travel through people, not places. Real cultural exchange, not check-ins. Because the best trips aren't about rooms, they're about people.**

## 🧠 Matching Logic
Passport Pals uses a **compatibility-based ranking system** that prioritizes shared interests, personality traits, language preferences, and travel style to surface the most relevant connections first. The algorithm is intentionally lightweight and transparent, designed for exploration rather than optimization.

## 🚧 Project Status
This project is a **portfolio prototype** built with **dummy data** for demonstration purposes. It focuses on product thinking, frontend architecture, and user experience rather than production-level security or scalability.
